Ways of Connecting Node + Angular

1
    - Node App Serves Angular SPA
    - Nose (Express) handles incoming requests
    - requests targeting "/" path return Angular SPA

2
    - Two Seperated Servers
    - Node (Express) handles incoming requests
    - Angular SPA sereved from seperate static host

In both Cases: Logically Seperated Apps


RESTful API
    Representation State Transfer 
    - Server(Node)
    - Client (Browser/Angular)
    - Stateless Backends

                        RESTful Server(API)
                /users             /posts           /products
            GET POST DELETE     GET POST PATCH    GET
